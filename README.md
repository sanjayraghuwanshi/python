**Problem:**
1. Install and use `unittest` (built-in). Write tests for your `BankAccount` class from Day 34.
2. Test: valid deposit, valid withdrawal, overdraft rejection, invalid (negative) amounts.
3. Write a test for your `is_palindrome()` function — include edge cases (empty string, single char, mixed case).
4. Write a test that checks file creation and content for your to-do file system from Day 27.
5. Run all tests and make sure they pass. Fix any bugs you find.

**Concepts:** `unittest`, `TestCase`, `assertEqual`, `assertRaises`, test-driven thinking

### Day 49 — Week 7 Mini Project: Personal Finance Dashboard
**Project:**
Build a personal finance tracker combining everything.

Features:
- `Transaction` class with date, amount, category, description, type (income/expense).
- `FinanceDashboard` class that manages all transactions.
- Load/save to JSON.
- Add income or expense.
- Monthly summary: total income, total expense, net savings.
- Category-wise breakdown.
- Filter transactions by date range or category.
- Export monthly report to `finance_report_<month>.txt`.

This should feel like a real mini-application.

# 🗓️ WEEK 8 — Capstone Project

**Goal:** Build one complete, polished Python application that showcases everything.

---

### Day 50 — Project Planning
**Task (No coding today):**
Plan your capstone project. Choose ONE from the options below (or propose your own):

**Option A — Student Management System**
Full CRUD for students, courses, grades, attendance. OOP, file persistence, reports.

**Option B — Inventory & Billing System**
Products, customers, invoices, stock management. CSV/JSON. Auto-bill generation.

**Option C — Personal Task Manager (CLI)**
Projects, tasks, priorities, deadlines, tags. Full OOP. Statistics dashboard.

Write a planning document with:
- Features list
- Classes and their responsibilities
- File structure
- Data storage format

---

### Day 51 — Core Models
**Task:** Build all your classes with `__init__`, `__str__`, properties. No app logic yet — just the data layer. Test each class works independently.

---

### Day 52 — Storage Layer
**Task:** Build the complete file I/O system. All data loads on startup, saves on change. Test that data persists correctly between runs.

---

### Day 53 — Business Logic
**Task:** Implement all the main features (add, edit, delete, search, filter, calculate). Write helper functions in a `utils.py`. Keep classes clean.

---

### Day 54 — User Interface (Console)
**Task:** Build the full menu-driven console UI. Each menu option calls the right method. Input validation everywhere — no crashes from bad input. Clear output formatting.

---

### Day 55 — Reports & Export
**Task:** Add all reporting features. Generate nicely formatted `.txt` reports with summaries. Test all edge cases — empty data, single items, large data sets.

---

### Day 56 — Testing & Bug Fixes
**Task:** Write unit tests for every major function. Run them. Fix all bugs. Try to break your own program with weird inputs. Polish error messages.

---

### Day 57 — Final Polish & README
**Task:** Clean up your code — consistent naming, remove dead code, add comments where needed. Write a proper `README.md` with:
- Project description
- How to run it
- Features list
- Sample screenshots (describe output)
- What you learned

---

### Day 58 — Reflection & What's Next

Congratulations — you made it! 🎉

**Today's task:** No coding. Instead, look back and reflect:
1. Open your Day 8 code and your Day 55 code. Notice the difference.
2. Write (in a text file or notebook) 3 things you found hardest and how you got past them.
3. Write 3 things you're most proud of from this journey.

**Where to go from here:**
- **Web Development** → Learn Flask or FastAPI to build web apps with Python.
- **Data Science** → Learn pandas, NumPy, matplotlib for data analysis.
- **Automation** → Learn `selenium`, `requests`, `BeautifulSoup` to automate tasks.
- **Databases** → Learn SQLite with Python (`sqlite3` or `SQLAlchemy`).
- **APIs** → Build or consume REST APIs using `requests` and Flask.
- **Open Source** → Find a beginner-friendly Python project on GitHub and contribute.

**The best next step:** Pick one area, build one real project in it. That's how you go from learning Python to *using* Python.
